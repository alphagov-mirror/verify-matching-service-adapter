# Remove support for European identities

This release removes matching for assertions sent from European identity schemes, as the UK is longer part of the eIDAS regulation.

> **_NOTE:_** If the configuration `europeanIdentity.enabled` is currently set to `true`, it must not be removed or changed. This flag affects the [type of JSON payload](3.0.0.md) sent to the local matching service.

You can remove all other `europeanIdentity` configuration.

The MSA will no longer regularly fetch aggregated country metadata and trust anchors, so you may wish to update network egress rules you may have for the following urls in your configuration:

```yaml
europeanIdentity:
  aggregatedMetadata:
    trustAnchorUri: <this url>
    metadataSourceUri: <this url>
```
